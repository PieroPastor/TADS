# TADS Development in C++

This repository contains two separate projects focused on the implementation of Abstract Data Types (TADs) in C++. Each project demonstrates different approaches to TAD development:

1. **TADs with Structs**: Implements TADs using C++ structs.
2. **TADs with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implements TADs using C++ classes and OOP principles.

## Projects Overview

### 1. TADs with Structs
This project showcases the development of TADs using C++ structs. It focuses on a procedural approach to data structure implementation.

### 2. TADs with OOP
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming principles to create and manage TADs. It includes features such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Folder Structure

├── structs-tads/       # TAD implementations using structs
└── oop-tads/           # TAD implementations using OOP
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PieroPastor/TADS.git
   cd TADS
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired project:**
   - For structs:
     ```bash
     cd tads-struct
     ```
   - For OOP:
     ```bash
     cd tads-oop
     ```

3. **Compile and run the code:**
   - Use `g++` or any C++ compiler to build the project files.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o program
     ./program
     ```
